	//	u will think that number number of attepts will be different in different cases. for best case , the situation will be that we chose a floor x, and and egg didnt break, then we chose
	//	x+1th floor and it broke, so we required only 2 attempts to find out the critical floor in best case.
	//	what happens in worst case??
	//	for every floor, we have 2 possibilites i.e the egg will break or it will not break;
	//	we dont what would the most optiomal floor to make the first attempt from so we are making attempt from every floor, 
	//	we also dont know if by dropping from a floor wheather the egg would break or not so we test for both the cases, 
	//	we recursively call the function for the left over floor and eggs, since we assume the worst possible case here and we do not 
	//	know if from dropping from a floor wheather the egg will break or not, we check for which situation it would take 
	//	greater number of attempts to find the critical floor and take that one.
